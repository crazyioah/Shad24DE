          <h2>Student Council 2024-2025</h2>
          <p>
            Born in Wuhan, China. Our Vice-President Tianze Yin, sought out a
            goal. A goal to infiltrate and spread his motherland‚Äôs traditions
            and practices to North America. He decided the best way to do this
            is to run for Student Council. He decided that he will need to
            become the Vice-President to conceal his true goals, and will pull
            the strings from the background, but he would first need someone
            that shares the same ideals to be the President. Back in 2021-2022,
            George Petroulakis was a prominent figure in the JUG room, with over
            24 JUGs and still managing to stay in the school. Now, a reformed
            nerd in 2024, having no JUGs and a 98% in Calculus, Tianze Yin
            realized George was perfect for his plan.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now the team needed support if they wanted a chance at winning, so
            they decided to get other students to help their cause. Back in
            2021, Yin began to be friend another fellow, Sihu Moon, and soon
            their friendship bloomed through their love. Through Sihu‚Äôs
            connections Tianze met other Chinese students such as Sean
            Jenguksavat (the Vice-Chairman) and Tristain Dang (the Secretary).
            Sihu later began to realize that his own companion, Tianze Yin, was
            becoming too powerful and decided that the only way to keep him in
            check was to run against him with his Canadian ally Mark Van
            Caseele, so they formed MVP. Yin now betrayed, realized that the
            only way to keep his competition in check is to recruit them so they
            stay quiet. He made Sihu Moon the Chairman, and Mark Van Caseele the
            First Lady, as Yin was upset about recruiting a Canadian ally in his
            Council. Oh yeah, there‚Äôs also Luc St. Laurent but he ain‚Äôt that
            important. Lastly, Adam Haleis, was offered the position of
            Ambassador, he accepted it. But before joining, he wanted to make
            sure his intentions were good enough for this school, and the truth
            is Tianze Yin just really wanted to benefit the school while making
            his nation proud. So he formed Mewing Academy, and joined with
            Kallon and Funmi to make the school a better place.
